Do not use these models
=======================
Altar.stl => attempt to make a 3D scene, split voronoi does not work since it is non manifold and contains a multitude of separate objects
Bottle.stl => non-manifold
Jewel.stl => first attempt at jewel 3D model
Potion.stl => low poly potion model
Wine.stl and WineVer2.stl => extremely laggy due to intense application of subdivision surfaces for extra smoothness
